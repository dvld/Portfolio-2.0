          I believe the effort you put into your work is only half the battle, there are many different ways to tackle
          the problems we face in life, but the way we manage and effectively deal with these problems can always be
          improved.

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <h5>Knowledge is power</h5>
        <p>
          I have struggled in the past to find purpose, after traveling down many difficult roads in my life I found my
          way into programming. A perfectionist at heart, with an affinity for problem solving, I knew from the start
          this was something I could pursue passionately. SMU taught me how much, and how quickly, we can learn; so long
          as we are committed to our goal, we can achieve anything.
